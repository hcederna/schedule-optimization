    "# Compare Optimized & Previous NESCAC Volleyball Conference Schedule Quads\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook picks up where the __[Optimize the NESCAC Volleyball Conference Schedule](./Optimize.ipynb)__ notebook left off. It is worthwhile to at least skim the previous notebook before proceeding.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We could theoretically use the best single optimized schedule year after year, but teams would play opponents at the same location each season. Each athlete would play the same opponent at the same location for all four years of her collegiate career.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid location repetition, we selected our two best optimized volleyball conference schedule quads based on a composite scoring metric––__[quad score](#quad_score)__––that quantifies the following cost, team experience, and location coverage goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Total Cost__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Minimize total cost__ to free additional capital for academic-related expenditures per the NESCAC's emphasis on academics over athletics. __[[1]](http://www.nescac.com/about/mission_statement \"NESCAC Mission Statement\")__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Home Games__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Ensure each team has at least one home game__ and __evenly distributes additional team home games__ to equitably allocate the home-court advantage between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Travel Duration__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Minimize and evenly distribute team travel duration__ to minimize and equitably allocate the travel-related fatigue and lost study hours between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Overnights \\*__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Minimize and evenly distribute team overnights__ to minimize and equitably allocate nights spent in hotels causing interruptions to player routine between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Different Locations__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Maximize and evenly distribute team different locations__ to reduce and equitably allocate the number of matches that occur between the same teams at the same location in back-to-back schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Unique Locations__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Maximize and evenly distribute team unique locations__ to maximize and equitably allocate each team's exposure to other schools in the conference. \n",

    "## Schedule Quad Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared to the previous NESCAC volleyball conference schedule quads, our `q6_1.5_3` and `q11_1.75_3` optimized schedule quads save money while improving or at least maintaining team home game experience, team travel experience, number of team overnights, and distribution of team unique locations. Our optimized schedules sacrifice the distribution of team overnights, number of team unique locations, and number and distribution of team different locations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both optimized schedule quads also __distribute team home games with a level of fairness in line with the previous NESCAC schedule quads__ based on the __[team home game fairness index](./Review.ipynb#fairness_index)__ where a value of 100 indicates that every team has the same number of home games––we have 100% fairness.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our optimized schedule quads reduce the four-year total cost by 21\\% on average compared to the previous 8 schedule quads while improving or at least maintaining the team home game experience and team travel experience. Our optimized schedules also improve (by reducing) the average number of overnights per team but sacrifice the even distribution of overnights between teams. Finally, our optimized schedules maintain the even distribution of team unique locations but sacrifice the remaining elements of team location experience—number of team unique locations, number of team different locations, and distribution of team different locations.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### A quick note on rescaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data point used in the quad schedule score metric is rescaled to a range of [0, 100] using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\quad X' = 100*\\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this rescaling, all score values are relative to the other schedules being analyzed. The `x_max` and `x_min` for the previous NESCAC and optimized schedule quads combined (as analyzed above) are different than the `x_max` and `x_min` for the previous NESCAC schedule quads analyzed alone, or the optimized schedule quads analyzed alone as shown in the __[Optimize the NESCAC Volleyball Conference Schedule](./Optimize.ipynb)__ notebook. The same schedule quad in each of these groups might have different rescaled and score values. Accordingly, before we compare scores, we need to ensure the score calculations include all of the schedule quads we wish to compare."

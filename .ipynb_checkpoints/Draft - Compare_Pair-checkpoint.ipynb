    "\n",
    "We could theoretically use the best single optimized schedule year after year, but teams would play opponents at the same location each season. Each athlete would play the same opponent at the same location for all four years of her collegiate career.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid location repetition, we selected our two best optimized NESCAC volleyball conference schedule pairs based on a composite scoring metric––__[pair score](#pair_score)__––that quantifies the following cost, team experience, and location coverage goals:\n",

    "- __Total Cost__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Minimize total cost__ to free additional capital for academic-related expenditures per the NESCAC's emphasis on academics over athletics. __[[1]](http://www.nescac.com/about/mission_statement \"NESCAC Mission Statement\")__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Home Games__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Ensure each team has at least one home game__ and __evenly distributes additional team home games__ to equitably allocate the home-court advantage between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Travel Duration__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Minimize and evenly distribute team travel duration__ to minimize and equitably allocate the travel-related fatigue and lost study hours between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Overnights \\*__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Minimize and evenly distribute team overnights__ to minimize and equitably allocate nights spent in hotels causing interruptions to player routine between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Team Different Locations__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Maximize and evenly distribute team different locations__ to reduce and equitably allocate the number of matches that occur between the same teams at the same location in back-to-back schedules.\n",
    "\n",

    "Both optimized schedule pairs also __distribute team home games at least as evenly as the previous NESCAC schedule pairs__ based on the __[team home game fairness index](./Review.ipynb#fairness_index)__ where a value of 100 indicates every team has the same number of home games––we have 100% fairness.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `p0_1_3` optimized NESCAC volleyball conference schedule pair reduces total cost by 23% on average compared to the previous 10 NESCAC volleyball conference schedule pairs while improving or at least maintaining the team home game experience, team travel experience, team overnight experience, and team location coverage. A win all around.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `p4_1.5_3` optimized schedule pair increases the minimum number of team home games from 1 and 1 in the `p0_1_3` optimized schedule pair to 1 and 2. It reduces total cost by 21% on average compared to the previous 10 NESCAC volleyball conference schedule pairs while improving or at least mantaining the team experience and location coverage. Not bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _A Final Note on the `p0_1_3` Schedule Pair_\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming each team has 14 players and 2 coaching staff, the decrease in total travel time in the `p0_1_3` schedule pair translates to __saving 1,526 study hours and 218 coach hours during the two seasons__ compared to the most travel-heavy 2015-16 season pair. __[[8]](./results/pair/figures/total_travel_duration_in_hours_comparison.png)__ __[[9]](./results/pair/figures/total_travel_duration_in_hours_change.png)__\n",
    "\n",
    "The decrease in total number of overnights in the `p0_1_3` schedule pair translates to __saving 256 nights spent away from home in a hotel during the two seasons__ compared to the most overnight-heavy 2016-17 season pair. __[[10]](./results/pair/figures/total_overnights_comparison.png)__ __[[11]](./results/single/figures/total_overnights_change.png)__"

    "### _Pair Score Formula_\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate pair score using the schedule score total cost weight (`TCW`) specified in the analyze schedule section of [configuration.py](./src/configuration.py) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pair Score =__\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\qquad TCW * Total\\:Cost\\:Rescaled + \\\\\n",

    "\\qquad (1 - TCW) * \\frac{1}{9} * Inverse\\:Team\\:Duration\\:in\\:Hours\\:Fairness\\:Index\\:Rescaled + \\\\\n",
    "\\qquad (1 - TCW) * \\frac{1}{9} * Team\\:Duration\\:in\\:Hours\\:Average\\:Rescaled + \\\\\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A quick note on rescaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data point used in the pair schedule score metric is rescaled to a range of [0, 100] using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\quad X' = 100*\\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this rescaling, the score values are relative to the other schedules being analyzed. The `x_max` and `x_min` for the previous NESCAC schedule pairs are different than the `x_max` and `x_min` for the optimized schedule pairs, which are different from the `x_max` and `x_min` for the previous NESCAC schedule pairs and optimized schedule pairs combined. The same schedule pair in each of these groups might have different score values. Accordingly, before we compare scores, we need to ensure the score calculations include all of the schedule pairs we wish to compare."
